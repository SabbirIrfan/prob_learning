```
The code statement from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator is importing the Iterable and Iterator abstract base classes from the collections.abc module in Python.

The Iterable class represents objects that can be iterated over using a loop, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries. Any class that defines the __iter__() method is considered an Iterable.

The Iterator class represents objects that support iteration and have a __next__() method to retrieve the next item in the iteration sequence. Objects that are Iterators can be generated using the iter() function on an Iterable object.

By importing these abstract base classes, you can use them to check if an object is an instance of Iterable or Iterator, or to define classes that implement the necessary methods to be treated as Iterable or Iterator objects.

```


```python
from collections.abc import Iterable, Iterator

# Define a custom class that implements __iter__() and __next__() methods
class MyIterator(Iterator):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.index = 0

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.data):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.data[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

# Create an instance of MyIterator
my_iter = MyIterator([1, 2, 3])

# Check if my_iter is an instance of Iterable and Iterator
print(isinstance(my_iter, Iterable))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(my_iter, Iterator))  # Output: True

# Iterate over my_iter using a for loop
for item in my_iter:
    print(item)
