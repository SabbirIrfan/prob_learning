@why hibernate instead of jdbc?

#eliminate boiler plate code 
#support of HQL which is objet oriented
# exception handling done by hibernateException

** # provides transaction management implicitly
**# caching for better performance


$$ important Interface used in Hibernate.
@SessionFactory >> init the factory once and it can be resued by caching 

@Session >> factory for transaction. its used to make ?physical? connection to the persistance store .  
transaction>> this specifies single /atomic units of work. roleback if some error happens.
