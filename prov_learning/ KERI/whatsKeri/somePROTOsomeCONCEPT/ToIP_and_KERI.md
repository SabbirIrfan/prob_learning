Trust over IP (ToIP) is an initiative aimed at establishing a trustworthy and interoperable digital trust ecosystem for individuals, organizations, and things on the internet. It seeks to address the challenges of digital identity, data exchange, and trust assurance in the increasingly interconnected and digital world. The underlying goal of ToIP is to create a global infrastructure that enables verifiable and trustworthy interactions online while preserving privacy, security, and user control.

Key components and principles of Trust over IP include:

1. **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs):** DIDs are a fundamental building block of ToIP, providing a standardized method for creating and managing self-sovereign digital identities. DIDs enable individuals and entities to control their identity information securely and independently of centralized authorities.

2. **Verifiable Credentials:** Verifiable credentials are digital attestations that can be issued, presented, and verified in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. They allow individuals to share relevant attributes and credentials with others while maintaining control over their personal data.

3. **Decentralized Key Management:** To ensure security and privacy, ToIP promotes the use of decentralized key management systems that enable secure storage and management of cryptographic keys for authentication and authorization purposes.

4. **Semantic Interoperability:** ToIP emphasizes the importance of semantic interoperability to enable shared understanding and communication among different systems and entities. By using standardized data models and ontologies, ToIP aims to enhance data exchange and trustworthiness.

Now, in collaboration with Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI), ToIP aims to advance decentralized and verifiable interactions by leveraging KERI's capabilities in key management, decentralized identifiers, and secure communication. KERI provides a mechanism for secure key management, signing, and verification, aligning with the principles of self-sovereign identity and decentralized trust models promoted by ToIP.

By integrating KERI's verifiable key event infrastructure with the principles and components of ToIP, the collaboration enhances the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of digital interactions, ultimately contributing to the creation of a more secure and trustworthy digital ecosystem. Together, Trust over IP and KERI work towards establishing a foundation for decentralized trust and interoperability, empowering individuals and organizations to securely manage their digital identities and data in the online world.
