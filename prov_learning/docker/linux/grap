grep command 

The grep command in Unix/Linux is used to search text using patterns. It is commonly used to search for specific strings in files. Here are some common examples:

Search for a string in a file:
grep "search_string" filename

Example: Search for the word "error" in logfile.txt:
grep "error" logfile.txt

Search recursively in directories:
grep -r "search_string" /path/to/search

Example: Search for the word "error" in all files under /var/log:
grep -r "error" /var/log

Search with case insensitivity:
grep -i "search_string" filename

Example: Search for "error" in logfile.txt, ignoring case:
grep -i "error" logfile.txt

Show line numbers with matches:
grep -n "search_string" filename

Example: Search for "error" and show line numbers in logfile.txt:
grep -n "error" logfile.txt

Search for whole words:
grep -w "search_string" filename

Example: Search for the whole word "error" in logfile.txt:
grep -w "error" logfile.txt
